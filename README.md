### [Generate a PacMan army and send them bouncing across the screen!](https://github.com/MorganMaltba/PacMan-Frenzy)

**Description:** <br>
This project creates a new PacMan at the click of the Add PacMan button. <br>
Click Start Game to send them flying across the screen!

**How to Run:** <br>
1. To run locally, download all files into the same directory, and open the index.html file in your broswer.<br>
2. To see it in action, go to [My Project Page](https://morganmaltba.github.io/PacMan-Frenzy/)!

**Roadmap of future improvements:**<br>
I plan to update the PacMen so that they will all chomp and change the direction they face on hitting the right-most boundary.
